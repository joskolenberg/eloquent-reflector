# Eloquent Reflector
A package to inspect Laravel's Eloquent models on available attributes and relations.

Serves as a dev dependency for the [laravel-jory](https://packagist.org/packages/joskolenberg/laravel-jory) package to provide some code generation.

Because of it's "hacky" nature not meant to be used in real production code.
